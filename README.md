# Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

# Getting Started

- After installing NodeJS in your system you would need to run the command `npm i` which would install all the dependencies.
- Next step would be to run the command `npm run build` which would transpile the typescript code to javascript code.
- The next command to execute would be `npm i -g` which would enable the cli command to be used globally.

# Executing Commands

- The command to execute is `parse-log`. 
- You can use `parse-log -help` to check the command arguments which should be passed to the cli command.
